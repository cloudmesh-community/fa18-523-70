# Big Data Application in recommender systems

| Author: Sushmita Dash

## Dataset

The data is downloaded from the below website
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

The movielens dataset contains 20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags. It contains the below csv files:

movies.csv
ratings.csv
links.csv
tags.csv
genome-scores.csv
genome-tags.csv

For the purpose of this project, we will use movies.csv and ratings.csv files only.
The above site also contains a smaller dataset containing 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users which we will use for the project
